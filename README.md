# üß† LangChain Arithmetic Agent with LangGraph

This project demonstrates an intelligent agent built using **LangChain** and **LangGraph**. It uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model to interpret and perform arithmetic operations such as **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** through tool calling.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Parses natural language arithmetic expressions like:
  > "Add 3 and 4, multiply by 2, and subtract 1"
- Custom tool implementation using LangChain.
- Dynamic conditional routing via LangGraph.
- Automatically determines whether to re-run tools based on the LLM's response.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- LangChain
- LangGraph
- OpenAI GPT-4o or Gemini 1.5 pro
- Zod (Schema Validation)
- dotenv

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-arithmetic-agent.git
   cd langchain-arithmetic-agent
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the project**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## üí° Example Usage

```js
const messages = [
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "Add 3 and 4. multiply by 2 and sub by 1 ",
  },
];
```

Expected Output:

```js
{
  messages: [
    {
      role: "assistant",
      content: "The result is 13.",
    },
  ];
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Tools**: Defined with LangChain's `tool` abstraction using `zod` schemas.
- **LLM Call**: `llmCall` node sends messages to GPT-4o with instructions.
- **ToolNode**: Executes any tool calls triggered by the LLM.
- **Conditional Routing**: Based on whether tools are requested, either loops back or ends the process.
