# 🧠 LangChain Arithmetic Agent with LangGraph

This project demonstrates an intelligent agent built using **LangChain** and **LangGraph**. It uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model to interpret and perform arithmetic operations such as **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** through tool calling.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Parses natural language arithmetic expressions like:
  > "Add 3 and 4, multiply by 2, and subtract 1"
- Custom tool implementation using LangChain.
- Dynamic conditional routing via LangGraph.
- Automatically determines whether to re-run tools based on the LLM's response.
