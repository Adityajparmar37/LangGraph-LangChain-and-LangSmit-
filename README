# 🧠 LangChain Arithmetic Agent with LangGraph

This project demonstrates an intelligent agent built using **LangChain** and **LangGraph**. It leverages OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model to interpret and execute arithmetic operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** via tool-calling capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- Parses natural language arithmetic queries like:
  > "Add 3 and 4, multiply by 2, and subtract 1"
- Uses LangChain `tool` abstraction for custom arithmetic tools.
- Constructs a LangGraph workflow with condition-based routing.
- Dynamically decides whether to invoke tools again based on LLM's response.

## 🧰 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-arithmetic-agent.git
   cd langchain-arithmetic-agent
   ```
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the project**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## 🧮 Example Input

```js
const messages = [
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "Add 3 and 4. multiply by 2 and sub by 1 ",
  },
];
```

Expected Output:

```js
{
  messages: [
    {
      role: "assistant",
      content: "The result is 13.",
    },
  ];
}
```

## 🧠 What's Going On?

### 1. LLM Node

`llmCall(state)` - Routes the message to GPT-4o with system instructions to parse and execute or plan tool use.

### 2. ToolNode

Executes custom tools (`add`, `sub`, `multiply`, `div`) if the model calls them.

### 3. Conditional Routing

After each `llmCall`, we check:

- If tools are called → go to tool execution
- Otherwise → finish execution
